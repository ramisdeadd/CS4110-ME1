Alan Turing's seminal paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), fundamentally changed the way we think about intelligence and machines. Instead of asking whether machines can really "think," Turing asks instead whether they might be induced to imitate human behavior well enough to make them indistinguishable from humans in conversation. Such an approach--under the guise of the Turing Test--actually shifts the focus away from abstract philosophy to empirical observation. In its turn, it led to having lasting effects on the philosophy of mind and in AI research.

Turing's confidence in the potential of machines to replicate human thought processes is remarkable, especially for the era in which he was writing. He systematically addresses objections to machine intelligence, including religious, mathematical, and philosophical concerns.

For example, he argued against the view that machines cannot feel or be conscious by pointing out that the former qualities do not have to exist for intelligent behavior to be manifested. Turing argued that if it can mimic human intelligence convincingly, then that machine is meaningful to call "intelligent". However, modern AI developments, while impressive in some ways, still challenge some aspects of Turing's vision. Today's AI can pass for human in certain tasks but exhibits no true understanding on most fronts, thereby challenging the model of behaviorism. Yet, of course, his work remains inspiring and is at the foundation of debates around consciousness, intelligence, and ethics in AI. His ideas are as relevant and provocative now as they were then.
